        <p>
                Memorize the tiles suggested by the computer and click the tiles following
                the built-up pattern, in the correct order, to advance to the next level.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Toggle between the game's difficulty modes by clicking the heading which reads MELODY. There are 3 modes: Easy, Hard and Pro. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Easy mode involves just black tiles and the Hard mode involves only white tiles, but the Pro mode houses the full C octave from a piano, with 13 tiles, i.e, both black and white.

        <h3>Score Calculation</h3>
        <p>
                Each successful level adds 100 points to your score. A wrong tile 
                ends the game.

                        First the obvious one: try using the melody created by the pattern to help you remember the tile sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In case of repeated notes occuring together, try hitting them quickly every time to help your ear remember that they are repeated.

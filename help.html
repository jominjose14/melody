                    <li>
                        First the obvious oneðŸ¥±: try using the melody created by the pattern to help you remember the tile sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In case of repeated notes occuring together, try hitting them quickly, together, every time, to help your ear remember that they are repeated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create mental breakpoints in your mind for the melody by observing a pause after a note of your choice. This trick may help you to break the long melody into smaller parts, instead of trying to remember the whole melody as a continuous stream of notes.ðŸ˜‰
